## Introduction <a name="Introduction"></a> <br>

Workout App is a modular workout app based on progressive overload. Users can create exercises with sets and reps, connect them into workouts, and then create a routine. Once it's set up, the app will automatically rotate through the workouts. On sucessful confirmation of the exercises, the reps and weight will increase.

## The App <a name="Games"></a> <br>

At some point, this app needs a name. Workout app is built with Blazor and is designed to be used on mobile phones and desktops. The main focus is keeping things simple, modular and infinitely cusomizable.
